  <h2>Lazy loading is the act of only loading parts of our app when they are needed.</h2>
  <p>
    The benefits are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep the initial payload small</li>
    <li>Smaller payloads lead to faster download speeds</li>
    <li>Lower resource costs especially on mobile networks</li>
    <li>If a user doesn't visit a section of our app, they won't ever download those resources</li>
  </ul>
